//* Nested Route can be used to show nested pages.

//? Link, NavLink and Navigate components are used to perform declarative routing.
//? For example: Link and NavLink are components that can be seen on the page and are directed by interacting with the user. (Nav etc.)

//? Navigate is used to programmatically redirect a link to another link that is not visible on the page. (v5 --> Redirect)

//* useNavigate() is convenient for imperative routing. For example, it can be used to programmatically redirect within a function, event or UseEffect.
